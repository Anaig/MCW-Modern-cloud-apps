# Modern cloud apps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure MSDN subscription

  - You will need permissions within the Azure Subscription and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to create users and setup Azure AD B2C.

- Local machine or Azure virtual machine configured with:

  - Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition or later
  - Windows Server 2019

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

Before initiating the hands-on lab, you will setup an environment to use for the rest of the exercises.

### Task 1: Deploy Lab VM Resources to Azure

1. Select the following **Deploy to Azure** button to deploy the ARM Template with the Lab VM resources for this lab. This link will deep link into the Azure Portal, passing in the ARM Template for deploying the resources for this lab.

    <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Modern-cloud-apps%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2Fscripts%2Flabvm%2Ftemplate.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
        <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** blade, enter the following:

    **Subscription**:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Select **Create new** and enter `ContosoSports-XXXXX`, where `XXXXX` is a unique suffix, such as your initials or a random number used to ensure a unique resource group name.

    > **Note**: For this lab, it is recommended you use the **East US**, **North Europe**, or **Australia East** Azure regions. There are certain Azure regions that don't support all the resources provisioned by the ARM Templates used by this hands-on lab.

    **Instance details**:

    - **Region**: Select the region you would like to use for this hands-on lab.
    - **Lab VM Admin Username**: Accept the default value of `demouser`.
    - **Lab VM Admin Password**: Accept the default value of `demo@pass123`.

3. Select **Review + create**.

4. Once validation has succeeded, select the **Create** button.

5. The deployment will take 15-30 minutes to complete. Continue to the next Task while this is deploying.

    To view the progress, select the **Deployments** link, then select the **Microsoft.Template** deployment.

    ![The template deployment status is shown.](media/deployments-microsoft-template.png "Resource group deployments")

    > **Note**: A configuration script to install SSMS and the requires lab files will run after the deployment of the LabVM completes. The task will be listed on the deployment progress screen as `LabVM/CustomScriptExtension`. You should wait for this task to complete before attempting to log into the LabVM in the next task, as it downloads and installs files you will need.

### Task 2: Deploy Environment Resources to Azure

1. Select the following **Deploy to Azure** button to deploy the ARM Template with the Environment resources for this lab. This link will deep link into the Azure Portal, passing in the ARM Template for deploying the resources for this lab.

    <a href ="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Modern-cloud-apps%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2Fscripts%2Fenvironment%2Ftemplate.json" target="_blank" title="Deploy to Azure">
        <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>

    >**Note**: If you have issues with the **Deploy to Azure** link, then do a new **Custom deployment** in the Azure Portal using the `/Hands-on lab/scripts/environment/template.json` ARM Template within the lab files.

2. On the **Custom deployment** blade, enter the following:

    **Subscription**:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Select the `ContosoSports-XXXXX` resource group you created in the previous task, where `XXXXX` is a unique suffix, such as your initials or a random number used to ensure a unique resource group name.

    **Instance details**:

    - **Region**: The region you assigned to the resource group above will be automatically selected.
    - **Lab VM Admin Username**: Accept the default value of `demouser`.
    - **Lab VM Admin Password**: Accept the default value of `demo@pass123`.

3. Select **Review + create**.

    ![The Custom deployment form is shown populated with the values described above.](media/custom-deployment-env.png "The Custom deployment form")

    > **Note**: The deployment may fail if you have not registered the `Microsoft.AppConfiguration` resource provider for the subscription you are using. To fix this, just navigate to your subscription and locate **Settings --> Resource providers**. Then search for `Microsoft.AppConfiguration`, select the resource provider, and select **Register**.
    >
